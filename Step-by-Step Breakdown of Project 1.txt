🔹 Step 1: Setting Up Virtual Machines
✅ What I did:

Installed Oracle VirtualBox to create and manage VMs.
Downloaded ISO files for:
Ubuntu (Target system)
Kali Linux (Attacker system)
Windows 10 (Optional)
Created three virtual machines (VMs) for each OS.

🧠 What I learned:

How to create VMs in VirtualBox.
The importance of a controlled testing environment in cybersecurity.



🔹 Step 2: Configuring Network Settings
✅ What I did:

Configured two network adapters for each VM:
NAT (For Internet Access)
NAT Network (For Internal VM Communication)
Set up static IPs for better connectivity:
Kali: 10.0.2.100
Ubuntu: 10.0.2.200

🧠 What I learned:

Difference between NAT and NAT Network:
NAT → Provides internet access to VMs.
NAT Network → Allows VMs to communicate with each other.
How to assign static IP addresses to interfaces.



🔹 Step 3: Testing Connectivity
✅ What I did:

Verified the network interfaces (ip a).
Used ping to test connectivity between VMs.
Ran Nmap from Kali to scan Ubuntu (nmap -A 10.0.2.200).
Enabled SSH server on Ubuntu (sudo apt install openssh-server).
Connected to Ubuntu via SSH from Kali (ssh vboxuser@10.0.2.200).

🧠 What I learned:

How to use ping to test network connectivity.
How to scan systems for open ports using Nmap.
How to configure and use SSH for remote access.



🔹 Step 4: Firewall & Security Settings
✅ What I did:

Installed and configured UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Ubuntu.

Allowed SSH traffic:
Open Terminal - sudo ufw allow 22/tcp

Enabled the firewall: 
open Terminal - sudo ufw enable

Verified firewall rules:
Open Terminal - sudo ufw status verbose
🧠 What I learned:

How firewalls restrict network traffic.
How to allow/block specific ports and protocols.
Why securing SSH is critical in cybersecurity labs.



🔹 Step 5: Persisting Configuration (Networking)
✅ What I did:

Edited network configuration files:
Ubuntu: /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
Kali Linux: /etc/network/interfaces
Applied settings with:

open Terminal -
sudo netplan apply  # Ubuntu
sudo systemctl restart networking  # Kali

🧠 What I learned:

How Linux persists network configurations across reboots.
How to troubleshoot connectivity issues with Netplan and interfaces files.



🎯 What Can I Learn from Project 1?
🔍 Key Cybersecurity Concepts:
Virtualization: Running multiple OSes in an isolated environment.
Network Security: Configuring firewall rules, IP settings, and SSH security.
Penetration Testing Basics: Using Nmap for reconnaissance.
System Administration: Managing users, services, and network configs.

💡 Real-World Applications:
This setup mimics a corporate network, allowing security teams to practice penetration testing.
Used in SOC (Security Operations Centers) for threat detection labs.
Helps red teams (attackers) and blue teams (defenders) test security tools.
